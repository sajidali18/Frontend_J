        <h2>1. Google App engine</h2>
        <img src="img.webp" alt="">
        <p>App Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform for building and hosting web applications at scale. It is called serverless because when you deploy your application in App Engine, the infrastructure underlying the application is completely managed by Google. <br>

            App Engine is Google's Platform-as-a-Service offering. It is a platform that allows you to host your applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure or scalability of the platform. The platform is completely managed by the service provider, in this case, Google Cloud Platform. As a comparison to any other provider, Red Hat offers OpenShift as a PaaS solution, and AWS offers Elastic Beanstalk as a PaaS solution. Pivotal’s Cloud Foundry service is also a PaaS solution. These platforms enable developers to manage their code rather than infrastructure. It’s more like CI/CD within a DevOps-driven environment, where developers focus on creating their code and then deploying it on the platform, and the platform will manage all the bells and whistles for the code to run in a scalable environment.</p>

    <p>The dark web is a part of the internet that isn’t indexed by search engines. You’ve no doubt heard talk of the "dark web" as a hotbed of criminal activity -- and it is. Researchers Daniel Moore and Thomas Rid of King’s College in London classified the contents of 2,723 live dark web sites over a five-week period in 2015 and found that 57% host illicit material.A 2019 study, Into the Web of Profit, conducted by Dr. Michael McGuires at the University of Surrey, shows that things have become worse. The number of dark web listings that could harm an enterprise has risen by 20% since 2016. Of all listings (excluding those selling drugs), 60% could potentially harm enterprises.You can buy credit card numbers, all manner of drugs, guns, counterfeit money, stolen subscription credentials, hacked Netflix accounts and software that helps you break into other people's computers. Buy login credentials to a $50,000 Bank of America account, counterfeit $20 bills, prepaid debit cards, or a "lifetime" Netflix premium account. You can hire hackers to attack computers for you. You can buy usernames and passwords.Not everything is illegal, the dark web also has a legitimate side. For example, you can join a chess club or BlackBook, a social network described as the "the Facebook of Tor."
