    <h1>What is Google App Engine</h1>
    <p>App Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform for building and hosting web applications at scale. It is called serverless because when you deploy your application in App Engine, the infrastructure underlying the application is completely managed by Google. <br>

        App Engine is Google’s Platform-as-a-Service offering. It is a platform that allows you to host your applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure or scalability of the platform. The platform is completely managed by the service provider, in this case, Google Cloud Platform. As a comparison to any other provider, Red Hat offers OpenShift as a PaaS solution, and AWS offers Elastic Beanstalk as a PaaS solution. Pivotal’s Cloud Foundry service is also a PaaS solution. These platforms enable developers to manage their code rather than infrastructure. It’s more like CI/CD within a DevOps-driven environment, where developers focus on creating their code and then deploying it on the platform, and the platform will manage all the bells and whistles for the code to run in a scalable environment.</p>
